# Resource Allocation System

The **Resource Allocation System** is a web application built using **React.js** that allows users to view and manage resources (such as personnel or assets) in a table format. The table displays the resource ID, name, experience, and skills. It fetches data from an API and uses animations to display the resource information in an engaging way.

## Features

- Displays a table with resources fetched from an API.
- Supports animations for table rows and cells when data is loaded.
- Handles loading and error states gracefully.
- Interactive table with hover effects on rows.
- The app provides a smooth user experience with fade-in and bounce animations for the resource data.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Styling the components, including animations.
- **Fetch API**: Used to retrieve data from the backend.
- **HTML**: Basic structure for the web app.

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

To clone the project to your local machine, open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/resource-allocation-system.git


2. Install dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd resource-allocation-system
npm install

3. Run the app
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the React development server and open the app in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

4. Backend Setup
If you are running a backend locally (for example, an Express API on http://localhost:8045), ensure that your API server is up and running.

To start the backend (if you have an Express server), navigate to the backend directory and run:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Make sure the API is responding correctly, as the frontend depends on it for data fetching.

### Step 2: Add the `README.md` to GitHub

1. After creating the `README.md` file in your project directory, make sure it’s committed to your Git repository.
   
2. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added README file"
git push origin main
This will push the README.md file to your GitHub repository.

Additional Tips
Badges: You can add various badges (like build status, license type, etc.) to the top of the README.
Screenshots: If you have a live demo or screenshots of your app, consider including them in the README to showcase your app’s UI.
Documentation for API: If the app interacts with an API, consider adding documentation about the API’s endpoints and how to set it up.
